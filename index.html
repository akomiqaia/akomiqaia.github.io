        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Akaki Mikaia from Georgia. I was born 23 years ago under the sign of Leo. I was grown up in Chkhorotsku* in a
          huge family. My family and farm environment helped me to develop a massive communal sense and also taking care
          of my surroundings (by that I mean how to grow different trees, vegetables or take care of animals). The life changed
          when I moved to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, for studies. In Tbilisi, I came to a realization of what technological
          and industrial development can bring to the society and how it brakes(or replaces) connections among people. one
          night, just discussing the topic my friends and I decided to start a project that would raise community awareness
          in our hometown, especially among in young people. The best way seemed to increase intellectual material and introduce
          different ideas from all over the world. In our hometown libraries resources were not enough to buy books that
          young people would read and discuss afterward.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My friends and I started a project for the local library. We were buying books for a local library every month. All
          the new books were represented by us and it became a platform to introduce new ideas to young people. The budget
          for the project was founded by local authorities, but in a few months, it also raised a good amount of donations
          from local businessmen. The project has been a real communal achievement that united the people of the small town.
          I stayed on the project for two years and now the project is managed by a really nice person from the town who
          enabled the project to go beyond the town and to cover a few surrounding villages. That was the beginning of understanding
          my philosophy of life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My philosophy of life can be described as deconstructionist. This way of thinking means to deconstruct or remove
          centers and help marginal areas to become more visible, but not for the sake of replacing the center. It's a state
          where marginal and center starts co-existing together in one harmonious circle. At the moment my aim is to help
          the new world to reach this harmonious state where everything is decentralized and spread around, like a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)"
            target="blank">Rhizome</a>. I believe that is achievable by helping local businesses and startups, or building environments that
          are free and easily accessible.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I strongly believe that Founders and Coders training can give me enough skill to take adventures and help bigger
          communities to become harmonious with surroundings and with itself as well.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>* Chkhorotsku is located in west Georgia and is an amazing place, full of nice people with incredible hospitality,
          not to mention the amazing nature of it. The picture for the home page was shot by at the mountains near my town;</p>
