        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Akaki Mikaia from Georgia. I was born 23 years ago under the sign of Leo. I grew up in Chkhorotsku* in a
          huge
          family. My family and rural environment helped me to develop a strong communal sense. It also taught me how
          to
          take care of my surroundings; How to grow different trees, vegetables or take care of animals. My life
          changed
          when I moved to Tbilisi (the capital city of Georgia) to study at university. In Tbilisi, I realized how
          technological
          and industrial development can break (or replaces) connections among people. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          One night, just discussing the topic, my friends and I decided to start a project that would raise the
          community awareness
          in our hometown, especially among young people. The best way seemed to increase intellectual resources, so
          that
          we could introduce new and different ideas from all over the world. To acomplish that, we started a project
          to
          provide the local library with brand new books and other materials, given its poor situation at that time. We
          were
          buying books for the library every month. We, then, were presenting the new materials and organizing talks
          and
          discissions about them. All this evolved and became a platform to introduce new ideas to young people. The
          project
          has been a real communal achievement that united the people of the small town. Now, the project has grown and
          its
          got adopted by the neighbouring villages. That was the beginning of understanding my philosophy of life. That
          was
          the beginning of understanding my philosophy of life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My philosophy of life can be described as deconstructionist. This way of thinking means to deconstruct or
          remove
          centres and help marginal areas to become more visible, but not for the sake of replacing the centre. It's a
          state
          where marginal and center starts co-existing together in one harmonious circle. At the moment my aim is to
          help
          the new world to reach this harmonious state where everything is decentralized and spread around, like a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)" target="blank">Rhizome</a>. I believe that is
          achievable by
          helping local businesses and startups and by building environments that are free and easily accessible.</p>
        <!-- <p id="quote">"As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the original source of 'things' and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those 'things'."</p> -->
        <br>
        <p>I strongly believe that Founders and Coders training can give me enough skill to help communities to become
          harmonious with surroundings and with itself as well.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>* Chkhorotsku is located in west Georgia and is an amazing place, full of nice people with incredible
          hospitality,
          not to mention the amazing nature of it. The picture for the home page was shot by me at the mountains near
          my
          town;
